Speckle makes integrating Unreal Engine with your 3D workflows even easier. </br>
This plugin connects Unreal Engine to Speckle, allowing you to receive your versioned 3D data from Speckle inside Unreal Engine,
enabling interoperable collaboration between Unreal and other Speckle connectors (Revit, Rhino, Blender, Sketchup, Unity, AutoCAD, [and more!](https://speckle.systems/features/connectors/))

## How to install

<!--- Soon to be!
Speckle for Unreal Engine can be installed through the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](com.epicgames.launcher://ue/marketplace/product/98770ce9d4f143de8dd7882a707a6f81).

Alternatively, developers may prefer to install manually.-->
1. Git clone [this repo](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unreal) (or download and extract the [archive zip](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unreal/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) into your project's `Plugins` directory (created as needed)
2. Open/Restart your Unreal project. This will build the plugin for your environment.

See our [docs](https://speckle.guide/user/unreal.html) for usage instructions.

If you encounter build issues, try building your project from VS/Rider directly. Look at the `Saved\Logs\` files for error messages,
and don't hesitate to reach out on our [community forums](https://speckle.community) for help!
